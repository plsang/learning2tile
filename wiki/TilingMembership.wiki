#Introducing Tiling Membership.

== Hard Membership ==

The tiling membership is represented by a vector the dimension of which equals to the number of tiles generated by the tiling function. For example the 3x3 *tiling parameter = c(3,3)* rectangle tiling yields a 9-dimensional vector.

The *integer* in each dimension indicates the membership of the current tiles. If no tiling membership is applied, the default tiling membership is set to (0,...m), where m is the number of tiles generated by the tiling function. In other words, each tiles has a unique membership.

The *unique* number of the integers in the vector denotes the number of total tiles after the membership mapping.
