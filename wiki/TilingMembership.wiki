#Introducing Tiling Membership.

== Hard Membership ==

The tiling membership is represented by a vector the dimension of which equals to the number of tiles generated by the tiling function. For example the 3x3 *tiling parameter = c(3,3)* rectangle tiling yields a 9-dimensional vector.

The *integer* in each dimension indicates the membership of the current tiles. If no tiling membership is applied, the default tiling membership is set to (0,...(m-1)), where m is the number of tiles generated by the tiling function. *Note the tiling membership starts from 0.* In other words, each tiles has a unique membership.


=== Examples ===
For the 2x2 rectangle tiling with tiling parameter equaling c(2,2) the following is the all possible hard tiling membership:
|| *Set Partition* ||
|| (0,0,0,1) ||
|| (0,0,1,0) ||
|| (0,0,1,1) ||
|| (0,0,1,2) ||
|| (0,1,0,0) ||
|| (0,1,0,1) ||
|| (0,1,0,2) ||
|| (0,1,1,0) ||
|| (0,1,1,1) ||
|| (0,1,1,2) ||
|| (0,1,2,0) ||
|| (0,1,2,1) ||
|| (0,1,2,2) ||
|| (0,1,2,3) ||




To generate a tiling with a specific membership use the following code:

<code language="R">
txyc_matrix = as.matrix(expand.grid(1:500,1:333))
base_tiling = TilingRectangle(2,2, txyc_matrix, 500, 333) #generate the base tiling
tiling_membership = c(0, 1, 2, 0)
mytiling = TilingMembership(base_tiling, tiling_membership )
PlotTiling(txyc_matrix, mytiling)
</code>
The following tiling would be displayed:

Let's try another example, in the context of the rectangle tiling with parameter 3x3, let's try to generate a tiling that has 3 row and 1 column (with parameter 3x1) by picking a suitable tiling membership parameter.
<code language="R">
txyc_matrix = as.matrix(expand.grid(1:500,1:333))
base_tiling = TilingRectangle(3,3, txyc_matrix, 500, 333) #generate the base tiling
tiling_membership = c(0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2)
mytiling = TilingMembership(base_tiling, tiling_membership )
PlotTiling(txyc_matrix, mytiling)
</code>
We will get the following figure:
