This article introduces the guild to generate the spatial BoW feature for a tiling.

== 1) Find a optimal tiling ==
Suppose we generate this report (see for how to generate it) and we find that <> is the promising tiling.

== 2) Set the environment variables (Optional) ==
Suppose we installed R at "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.2\bin" on Windows, we add this variable to the "Path". 

See [http://www.divms.uiowa.edu/help/windows/RPackage.html here] for more information.

On Linux suppose the R home directory is "/data/MM2/R/bin", type

{{{
export PATH=${PATH}:/data/MM2/R/bin
}}} 

See [http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/set-environment-variable-linux/ here] for more information.

== 3) Download the source package ==
 # Unzip the archive in a folder.
    * a txyc file is the mapping file from centroids to each point's SIFT feature. For example:
      {{{
       10 7 431 569 152 874 504 796 587 37 570 381
       16 7 729 940 600 942 13 992 751 795 945 273
       22 7 316 955 353 163 351 596 570 856 385 432
       28 7 768 203 771 527 477 634 968 847 641 963
       34 7 914 587 120 442 520 714 403 483 569 401
      }}}
    * The file name ending with ".r" are source files.
    * "labels.labels" is the class label file.
    * "partition[1-5].par" are the training and test partition used in the cross validation.
