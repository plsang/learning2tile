This article introduces the guild to generate the spatial BoW feature for a tiling.

== 1) Find a optimal tiling ==
Suppose we generate this report (see for how to generate it) and we find that <> is the promising tiling.

== 2) Set the environment variables (Optional) ==
Suppose we installed R at "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.2\bin" on Windows, we add this variable to the "Path". 

See http://www.divms.uiowa.edu/help/windows/RPackage.html

On Linux suppose the R home directory is "/data/MM2/R/bin", type

{{{
export PATH=${PATH}:/data/MM2/R/bin
}}}
